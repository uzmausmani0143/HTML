<h1><u>Cybersecurity</u></h1>

<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. 
Also known as information technology (IT) security, cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against 
networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.</p>

<p>Security system complexity, created by disparate technologies and a lack of in-house expertise, can amplify these 
costs. But organizations with a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, governed by best practices and automated using 
advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, can fight cyberthreats more effectively and 
reduce the lifecycle and impact of breaches when they occur.</p>

<p>A strong cybersecurity strategy has layers of protection to defend against cyber crime, including cyber attacks 
that attempt to access, change, or destroy data; extort money from users or the organization; or aim to disrupt normal
 business operations.Countermeasures should address:</p>

<p><b>work security</b> - Security measures for protecting a computer network from intruders, including both wired and wireless 
(Wi-Fi) connections.</p>

<p><b>Application security</b> - Processes that help protect applications operating on-premises and in the cloud. 
Security should be built into applications at the design stage, with considerations for how data is handled,
 user authentication, etc.</p>

<p><b>Cloud security</b> - Specifically, true confidential computing that encrypts cloud data at rest (in storage), 
in motion (as it travels to,from and within the cloud) and in use (during processing) to support customer privacy,
 business requirements and regulatory compliance standards.</p>

<p><b>Information security</b> - Data protection measures, such as the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR,
 that secure your most sensitive data from unauthorized access, exposure, or theft.</p>

<p><b>End-user education</b> - Building security awareness across the organization to strengthen endpoint security.
 For example, users can be trained to delete suspicious email attachments, avoid using unknown USB devices, etc.</p>

<p><b>Disaster recovery/business continuity planning</b> - Tools and procedures for responding to unplanned events, such as natural 
disasters, power outages,or cybersecurity incidents, with minimal disruption to key operations.</p>

<p><b>Storage security</b> - IBM FlashSystem® delivers rock solid data resilience with numerous safeguards. This includes 
encryption and immutable and isolated data copies. These remain in the same pool so they can quickly be restored to
 support recovery, minimizing the impact of a cyber attack.</p>

<p><b>Mobile security</b> - IBM Security® MaaS360 with Watson enables you to manage and secure your mobile workforce with app security, 
container app security and secure mobile mail.</p>
