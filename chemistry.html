			<p>  <strong><font color=darkpink><code>Chemistry</code></font></strong> also is concerned with the utilization of <font color=green>natural</font> substances and the creation of artificial ones. <em>Cooking, fermentation, glass making,</em> and <em>metallurgy</em> are all chemical processes that date from the beginnings of civilization. Today, <strong>vinyl, Teflon, liquid crystals, semiconductors, and superconductors</strong> represent the fruits of chemical technology.</p>
		
				<blockquote>The atom is the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud.</blockquote>
		
			<p> The 20<sup>th</sup> century saw dramatic advances in the comprehension of the marvelous and complex <font=violet><font color=darkpink>Chemistry</font></font> of living organisms, and a molecular interpretation of health and disease holds great promise. Modern <font=violet><font color=darkpink>Chemistry</font></font>, aided by increasingly sophisticated instruments, studies materials as small as single atoms and as large and complex as <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, which contains millions of atoms. New substances can even be designed to bear desired characteristics and then synthesized. The rate at which chemical knowledge continues to accumulate is remarkable. Over time more than <mark>8,000,000</mark> different chemical substances, both <font color=green>natural</font> and artificial, have been characterized and produced. The number was less than <mark>500,000</mark> as recently as 1965.</p>
